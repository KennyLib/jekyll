            This article describes the increasingly popular Microservice architecture pattern. The big idea behind microservices is to architect large, complex and long-lived applications as a set of cohesive services that evolve over time. The term microservices strongly suggests that the services should be small.

            Some in the community even advocate building 10-100 LOC services. However, while it’s desirable to have small services, that should not be the main goal. Instead, you should aim to decompose your system into services to solve the kinds of development and deployment problems discussed below. Some services might indeed be tiny where as others might be quite large.

            The essence of the microservice architecture is not new. The concept of a distributed system is very old. The microservice architecture also resembles SOA.
