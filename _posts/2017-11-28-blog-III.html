            This article describes the increasingly popular Microservice architecture pattern. The big idea behind microservices is to architect large, complex and long-lived applications as a set of cohesive services that evolve over time. The term microservices strongly suggests that the services should be small.
        </p>    
        <p>
            Some in the community even advocate building 10-100 LOC services. However, while it’s desirable to have small services, that should not be the main goal. Instead, you should aim to decompose your system into services to solve the kinds of development and deployment problems discussed below. Some services might indeed be tiny where as others might be quite large.

            The essence of the microservice architecture is not new. The concept of a distributed system is very old. The microservice architecture also resembles SOA.
        </p>
        <p>
            It has even been called lightweight or fine-grained SOA. And indeed, one way to think about microservice architecture is that it’s SOA without the commercialization and perceived baggage of WS* and ESB. Despite not being an entirely novel idea, the microservice architecture is still worthy of discussion since it is different than traditional SOA and, more importantly, it solves many of the problems that many organizations currently suffer from.
        </p>  
        <p>     
            In this article, you will learn about the motivations for using the microservice architecture and how it compares with the more traditional, monolithic architecture. We discuss the benefits and drawbacks of microservices. You will learn how to solve some of the key technical challenges with using the microservice architecture including inter-service communication and distributed data management.

        <h3>The (sometimes evil) monolith</h3>
        <p>
            Since the earliest days of developing applications for the web, the most widely used enterprise application architecture has been one that packages all the application’s server-side components into a single unit. Many enterprise Java applications consist of a single WAR or EAR file. The same is true of other applications written in other languages such as Ruby and even C++.
        </p>  
        <p>   
            Let’s imagine, for example, that you are building an online store that takes orders from customers, verifies inventory and available credit, and ships them. It’s quite likely that you would build an application like the one shown in figure 1.
